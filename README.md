# tf-recom-app

Here, I will create an application that generates training data for 
interactions between IDs and items, and allows a user to query an ID and 
obtain their top recommendations.

For fun, I will parallelize the training and make some basic web app that 
runs locally.  In addition, I will save model progress and allow for 
checkpoints and all the nice things to not have to retrain the model every 
time you have new data.
